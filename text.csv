INTRO, The ancient Order. NEXT The constant that nurtured this world. NEXT The mad King. NEXT A paranoid power that ruled this world. NEXT The King feared the order. NEXT He claimed that they are scheming behind his back. NEXT Plotting to get his crown. NEXT In realty the Order was a peaceful monastery, commited to helping the poor and those in need. NEXT The reason however fell deaf on the King's ears. NEXT He ordered to burn the monastery to the ground. NEXT Turning it to ashes with it's residents. NEXT There were no survivors. NEXT Except for a single monk. NEXT Boucler. NEXT He swore vengence against the King. NEXT He swore to give him the same treatment as he gave to Boucler's brethren. NEXT But one monk can do very little. NEXT Boucler knew however of an ancient tome, deep in the caverns of Pieuvre. NEXT Not a single person ever succeded in exploring the caves. NEXT However Boucler was no ordinary person. NEXT As he knew of an ancient technique...
LVL1INTRO, It's the right cave, I'm sure of it. NEXT I can feel the evil power that lingers here... NEXT Let's hope what I learned will be enough.
LVL2INTRO, It works! NEXT I can't believe it! NEXT I will avenge you my brothers... NEXT No matter what it takes, I'll make sure King gets what he deserves...
